# APPTRACK

## Description

Apptrack is a job application tracker built with React and Redux. This application allows a user to upload PDF resumes, log job applications, and organize the applications with folders.

## Roadmap

I would like to integrate AWS so that users can have their uploads persist via cloud storage. I would also like to refactor the folders carosel to be more mobile friendly.
